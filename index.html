<h3>Key items to remember from Project 0:</h3>
</div>
<div class="concept" id="project-1-3">
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>What a Web Page is</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>How Coding Works</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
look like this:
I'm learning to code!
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>Computers are Stupid</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). 
For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.</b> This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up. 
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>Basic HTML Vocabulary (Tags and Elements) </h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
<p>
Tags: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p&gt;). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag). In my Project 0, I had excellent feedback which assisted with correcting this information so tags would not be wrongfully interpreted markup.
</P>
<p>
Elements: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. 
</P>
<p>
Attributes: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;/a href=www.udacity.com>

<h3>Key items to remember from Project 1: </h3>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Topic: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept" id="project-1-4">
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>Text Editors (for programming)</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>Avoiding Repetition</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
It is important to avoid repetition to help consistency and avoid errors.  By avoiding repetition it helps reduce errors when making minor changes on repeated codes. By using the same div it allows assigning a class, which you can give a specific style and it will repeat throughout the HTML, as assigned. 
</div>
<div class="concept-title">
<h2>CSS</h2>
</div>
<div class="concept-description">
There are three ways to include CSS styling in your web page.  First is to Write CSS in the &lt;head&gt;  of your HTML.  Another is to link your HTML to a separate CSS File.  Last you can write your style inline with your HTML.
